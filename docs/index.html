      <h3>What is an audiodrama?</h3>
      <p>An audiodrama is a <b>scripted, voice-acted, fiction podcast</b>, similar to a TV show without the visual aspect. Audiodramas are a relatively niche medium dominated by small creators.</p>
      <h3>What is this website?</h3>
      <p>This website is a record of audiodramas I've lisened to and my short review of them, designed to be easily searched. Ratings of audiodramas on this website are subjective to how much I enjoyed them, not how objectively good they are. I personally don't like horror audiodramas, but just about any other genre can be found here.</p>
