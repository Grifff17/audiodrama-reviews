      <h1>Grifff's Audiodramas Reviews</h1>
      <h3>What is an audiodrama?</h3>
      <p>An audiodrama is a <b>scripted, voice-acted, fiction podcast</b>, similar to a TV show without the visual aspect. Audiodramas are a relatively niche medium dominated by small creators.</p>
      <h3>What is this website?</h3>
      <p>This website is a record of audiodramas I've listened to and my short review of them, designed to be easily searched. Shows are roughly sorted by how much I like them, but picking favorites is hard so take that with a grain of salt. I personally don't like horror or anthology shows, but just about any other genre can be found here. The copy reviews button lets you copy multiple reviews to your clipboard to share elsewhere on the internet.</p>
