# Grifff's Audiodrama Catalog

Database of audiodramas I have listened to.

**Project Specifications**

Every audiodrama I have listened that I would recommend is in the database.

Each audiodrama has:
- name
- rating out of 10
- short review/description
- list of tags (sci-fi, comedy, musical, etc.)

Audiodramas are sorted by rating.

The database is searchable by name and tags.

There is a way to select multiple audiodramas, and a button that copies the description of all selected audiodramas to the clipboard.

New Audiodramas are added to the database via manual updating of data.json.
